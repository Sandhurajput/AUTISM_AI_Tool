## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Models not loading**
**Solution:**
```bash
cd /home/navgurukul/Documents/AUTISM_MAIN/autism/client/public/models
ls -lh
# Should see 4 files (2 manifest, 2 shard)
```

### **Issue: No face detected**
**Causes:**
- Poor lighting in photo
- Face not clearly visible
- Multiple faces in photo
- Face too small

**Solution:** Use clear, well-lit photo with single visible face

### **Issue: Emotion detection slow**
**Reason:** First time loads models (~500KB)
**Solution:** Normal - subsequent detections are fast
